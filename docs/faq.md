## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we use our existing EMU organization for Skills exercises?

While it is technically possible, we strongly recommend creating a dedicated "learning organization" for all GitHub Skills activities and other training purposes.

This approach isolates learning environments from production work which may differ in security policies and restrictions.

### Are enterprises using Data Residency (`ghe.com`) supported?

Enterprises using Data Residency on `ghe.com` are not supported due to critical limitations, including:

- GitHub Codespaces are unavailable.
- GitHub Actions differences on `ghe.com` prevent necessary workflows from running.

### What is the purpose of the actions allow list?

If you choose not to allow all actions in your learning organization, you must explicitly approve every action required to run the exercises.

The allow list specifies the minimum set of actions required for the exercises to function correctly. This list is updated periodically as new exercises are created or existing ones get updated.

### Why is GitHub Codespaces required ?

### How much will this cost?
