# GitHub Skills for Enterprise Managed Users (EMU)

This repository is a guide for enabling GitHub Skills exercises in your Enterprise Managed User (EMU) organizations.

## Why is special configuration needed for EMU?

GitHub Skills exercises were designed to be taken in an individual's GitHub account where each user has full control over their settings.

Enterprise Managed User (EMU) accounts often do not have permissions to create repositories under their GitHub handles.

This guide helps you configure your organization with settings that will allow your employees to take the exercises within your organization.
